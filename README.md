# Syllabus

* Workshop: WEB PROGRAMMING; RISD GRAPH-3188 (26268)
* Fall 2017, 1:10pm–6:10pm, Fridays. Room 404
* 1 credit
* Instructor: Marie Otsuka (motsuka@risd.edu) (cell: 617-852-8392)

This three-session workshop combines the tactical skills needed to structure web pages with a looser more playful compositional mindset. Students are introduced to writing HTML and CSS through hands-on demos, in-class exercises and take-home assignments. Typographic markup and hierarchy establishes the basis for more abstract form making in week two. Week three incorporates interaction, introducing CSS3 transform, animation, and other user-controlled properties. The final assignment for week four will allow you to combine what you learned in the first three weeks.

## Course objectives
* Be introduced to HTML and CSS syntax to help conceptualize future projects
* Encourage use of the browser as a place for experimentation
* Introduce both analytical and playful working methods
* Be introduced to instructions-based making — HTML being one of many coding methods
* Be comfortable editing existing themes or websites
* To learn how to find answers online to coding problems
* Learn to work collaboratively in an open-source model

## Schedule
### Week One: Content
>Week one emphasizes the strategic and deliberate construction of space on a web page, working with content. 
* Assignment 1: Semantically markup and style some text
	Continue with the in-class exercise to practice formatting content. Try to use semantic elements (<section> <h1> <p> <em>) as appropriate.
* Assignment 2: Create a multi-page website
	Create a website that consists of at least 3 different pages, linking them together with relative paths. You should use a single stylesheet for all your pages.


### Week Two: Form
>Week two encourages a different mindset, using code and the browser to discover designs as you make.  
* Assignment 3: Draw concrete objects using CSS shapes or repeat abstract shapes to create a pattern
	Play with CSS properties, positioning, z-index, overflows to "draw" in the browser
* Assignment 4: Compose a web poster — use abstract shapes / grids
	Apply your understanding of "chunks" ans sectioning to create a one-page layout with graphics and text. You may use Muller-Brockman posters as a guide, or one of your own. 

### Week Three: Behavior
>Week three delves into designing with time, adding interactivity and motion.
* Assignment 5: Animate your web poster and set triggers with jQuery
* Final: Combine your skills to make a responsive website

### Week Four
>Putting it all together
* From sketch to code
* Review examples
* Possible explorations

## Software needed
* Download [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) or other HTML editor, such as [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* Join GitHub and  we'll add you to the team!
* Download [GitHub Mac client](https://desktop.github.com/) and clone the [class repository](https://github.com/risd-web/wp-fall17)
* Test in Google Chrome, Safari, and/or Firefox — assignments will be evaluated in Chrome
* Use [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/wpfall17/shared_invite/MjM3OTUzODE5MzE1LTE1MDQ4NDYxNjgtOTg3NzM1MmI0NQ) for communicating with classmates

## Resources
* Clone/sync the [Demos Repository](https://github.com/risd-web/wp-demos)
* Review the [lectures](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3lDDEnD7CkNN0xvMEI1QmkyNkE?usp=sharing) are available on Google Drive 
* Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/risd-web/wp-fall17/wiki) on the Github page for useful resources
* Quick reference when [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/risd-web/wp-fall17/wiki/Common-Errors)
* Check out & add to [Sites](https://github.com/risd-web/wp-fall17/wiki/Sites) for inspiration
* Clone the Github Repo from the [previous class](https://github.com/risd-web/wp-spring17)

## Grading
* 40% attendance, 40% completion of all assignments
* 20% risk-taking/quality of end forms: you are expected to experiment, iterate and form innovate designs with the coding that you’ve been shown. Because work from previous sessions is available, you are able to reuse code, but in service of your own ideas and forms.
* Missing one class without permission fails the course
* Although we are “wired” throughout the workshop, avoid being plugged into Facebook, email, etc.
