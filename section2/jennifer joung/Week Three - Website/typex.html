	       <p> This project investigates systematic typographic structure, the minutia of legibility, the power of variations in form and the meaning they hold. Through this letterform exploration, I learned to leverage limited and controlled systems, integrate unexpected conditions, develop an appreciation for the influence of tools, and an eye for craft. The two appraoches were: typeface construction and lettering. The purpose of the two modes was to exaggerate the differences between the two.</p>

	       <p> Modular Type: letterforms as system Use consistent structures, recognizable build pattern between characters, a system that’s evident. It should act as a study for a full alphabet design. Letterforms are one color, no shading, vector. </p>

	       <p> Lettering: word as image, letterform as picture The word may act illustratively, pictorially, or use materials and textures which communicate as strongly in metaphor as the written meaning of the word. Final word does not need consistent structure between letters. </p>

                This project investigates systematic typographic structure, the minutia of legibility, the power of variations in form and the meaning they hold. You’ll learn to leverage limited and controlled systems, integrate unexpected conditions, develop an appreciation for the influence of tools, and an eye for craft. You’ll do this all while try out a few approaches to designing letterforms.
                We’ll sample two modes: typeface construction and lettering. Our approach will exaggerate the differences between the two. These practises frequently intermingle and are closely related, but you’ll be asked to explore them as (synthetically) distinct studies…

       <p> Modular Type: letterforms as system Use consistent structures, recognizable build pattern between characters, a system that’s evident. It should act as a study for a full alphabet design. Letterforms are one color, no shading, vector. Must be based on assigned grid: .25 x .25-inch squares. Original design of full word must fit in 8.5x11-inch, horizontal page. Must be legible.</p>

       <p> Lettering: word as image, letterform as picture The word may act illustratively, pictorially, or use materials and textures which communicate as strongly in metaphor as the written meaning of the word. Final word does not need consistent structure between letters. Letterforms can use different values in color or shades. Open format. Must be legible.
