          <p class="subhead">   Q: Can a complex issue be presented in a simple way?</p>

          <p> 
            Is it true that “A picture is worth a thousand words?” How do you choose a proper way of data visualization? Does objective information even exist? How to present relative and statistical data? How does cultural and language context affect the understanding of an image?
          </p>
           <p>
            The role of data visualization and infographics has been increasing in the contemporary world, where the image communication keeps gaining importance. Image dominates news design, advertising and persuasive graphics, interfaces, as well as social communication networks (emoticons, the “like” button, and so on). Visualization is a tool that helps to organize, explain, inform, prove/confirm, change behavior, inspire.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this infographics unit, we explored three different ways of visualizing complex information. For the first infographic, we were limited to solely utilizing texts and type choices. For the next, we were given the opportunity to integrate graphs (pie charts, bar charts, etc) to show our statistical data. Lastly, an infographic which incorporates visual representations/pictorial visuals. 
          </p>

          <p> For the first infographic, we were limited to the use of purely typography. It pushed me to understanding the language and the ___ of how typography could give off the spirit before the audience even reads the actual information/text. The next poster, we were limited to the use of typography but also graph structures. </p>
