        <h2> “I want you to know, if you ever read this, there was a time when I would rather have had you by my side than any one of these words; I would rather have had you by my side than all the blue in the world.

All right then, let me try to rephrase. When I was alive, I aimed to be a student not of longing but of light.” </h2>
