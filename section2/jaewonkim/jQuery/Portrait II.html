<h2> What color is abstraction? It can’t just be white. Its invention in time
(for example, 1910 or 1912) only means that it creates a holding space for
abstractions from other times and places. To centrally locate one locus of
abstraction would be to diminish the radicality of abstraction’s connections
to its others—or its engendering of its others.
Around 1912, high art abstraction, what became museum abstraction, is
discovered—not invented—in Europe. This discovery is a little like Columbus
discovering America as a by-product of his quest to find a shortcut
to India. “Indians” are a tell-tale sign (in Edgar Allan Poe’s sense) that
America was already spoken for (if not claimed). White abstraction is
important not only for itself but also for the portal it opened onto the
already existing abstraction in the first, second, third, and fourth worlds.
How many senses of abstraction is it possible to imagine in terms of
concrete art practices? In the futurist moment and the years immediately</h2>
