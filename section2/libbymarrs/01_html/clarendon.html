<p>Clarendon began as an exercise to create a font that could emphasize text within normal type. It was meant to be a bold “related” typeface, that could be inserted into text bodies of Times or other standard serif typefaces. The practice of substituting normal type for a slab serif like Clarendon was commonly used in lieu of italics to highlight certain parts of a text. The typeface dates back to 1845, one of the first fonts of its kind. It is attributed to Robert Besley of Fann St. Foundary, who later went on to become the mayor of London. Such an important man should be creators of equally historically significant typefaces, and Clarendon lives up to his legacy. </p>

<p>During Clarendon’s early years, it enjoyed a burst of popularity. Sir Besley had it patented, but that only lasted three years, and it fell victim to many font-stealing type foundries that produced and sold dupes. Its influence on popular culture extended well beyond the borders of Great Britain, and it’s seen so many revivals and reinterpretations that we might as well reference it as the plural “Clarendons” rather than the singular. French Clarendon is a product of the 19th century, popularly known as “Old Western” Clarendon, the characteristic font used on those classic “WANTED” signs from the movies. That’s an anecdote I am particularly excited to learn about—I had no idea that Old West type derived from Clarendon. French Clarendon was a drastically altered form of the typeface, with its exaggerated top and bottom thickness and contrastingly thin vertical stroke. It was also extremely compressed, and this version of the typeface served as a novelty for poster headlines, rather than a practical insertion into body text of a newspaper, as the original was intended for. </p>

<p>Clarendon came at a time of rapid industrialization and development for printing, as letterpress technology was steadily improving to accommodate larger bodies of text, and print them more efficiently for newspapers. It was first carved into wood type at a foundry, to be used in a letterpress.  Inventions of the first half of the 19th century include the iron-frame (rather than wood) letterpress, and the first cylindrical press. As large blocks of body text became easier to produce, typefaces like Clarendon, functional in such text to highlight aspects, were in demand and readily consumed. Clarendon stood out compared to other bold “related” fonts of the 1840s. Its boldness throughout the letterform created a lack of extreme contrast, its serifs bracketed (thicker toward the stroke), and its X-height high, all combining to create a successful, readable face that fit nicely alongside body text fonts.</p>

<p>Clarendon’s initial purpose at the time of its invention, placement in body text like italics, has gone extinct alongside many things from the 1800s, but the typeface is still very much alive. Its endless versions and interpretations are still prevalent both in traditional text and in popular culture. French Clarendon is still used, often ironically nowadays, in posters or titles, engrained in our society as the font of the Old West. It’s great to make the connection that this style was birthed far from the southwestern U.S. where I call home, in London, 1845. </p>
