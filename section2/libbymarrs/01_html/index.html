<p>Helvetica was developed to be an extremely readable and versatile sans-serif typeface that could compete with others, as the neo-grotesque style was beginning to soar in popularity. It was created in the Swiss type foundry called Haas Type Foundry, engineered by Max Miedinger with Eduard Hoffmann, based in Münchenstein, Switzerland. In the year 1957 the designers engineered Helvetica, initially called Neue Haas Grotesk, aimed at being comparable to Akzidenz Gotesk, another typeface created by Haas. This initial version of what would turn out to be Helvetica was not created to be a full font family of mechanical type, but was licensed to Linotype and further developed by Arthur Ritzel of Stempel. I used to think that Helvetica was the original iconic sans-serif, but it was based on preexisting typefaces. Univers came before Helvetica was a fully developed typeface, and its success influenced Helvetica’s progression into an entire font family of different widths and weights. In 1960, Stempel of Linotype renamed it “Helvetica,” which means Swiss in Latin, to make it more marketable.</p>

    Stempel developed Helvetica to be a modern, marketable typeface with many stylistic variations and weights, as well as designing it for both metal type and phototypesetting.</div> 
<p>Phototypesetting is a method of printing type by projecting light through a photographic film negative of a single letter onto photo paper. It was new, exciting technology at the time, but became obsolete during the transition into the digital age. Helvetica, however, readily adapted to the new age of computers beginning in the late 1970’s and 1980’s, and was licensed to Xerox, then Adobe and Apple. It solidified its presence in the world of printing, analog and now digital, when it was made one of the core PostScript fonts in the first computers.</p>

watch this cool video so youre never in danger of being a paste eating discrace to swiss graphic design

<p>Helvetica has coasted its way right into 2017 full-tilt with no sign of losing its momentum. Its unwavering popularity makes some designers scoff at its overuse—but it’s really amazing to me that there is a font that is so universally applicable. Its strikingly simple yet friendly rounded, square-dimensioned proportions make it easy to use to title any situation. It’s extremely popular among all types of company branding, from American Apparel to American Airlines, as well as official government organizations like NASA. Sure—at this point, falling back on Helvetica to make something look good can be brushed off as laziness, but we must appreciate how much power one single typeface can have over the world. Literally, the world—there are versions of Helvetica for multiple language, including Latin, Hindi, Korean, Japanese, Hebrew, and Greek.</p>
