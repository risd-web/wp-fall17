 <h2> Twen Magazine </h2>
 
<p>Twen magazine made its first debut in 1959, when Europe was beginning to recover from the horrors and destruction of World War II. Directed towards the first generation of the post-war youth, Twen magazine, deriving its name from the English word, “twenty”, covered a wide range of contents from politics, relationships, fashion to pop culture. Since it’s first issue in 1959 till it’s very last issue in 1971, Willy Fleckhaus served as the art director of Twen magazine. As Europe was trying to recuperate from the horrors of the war, Willy Fleckhaus was given the hardest challenge: to start from nothing and recreate culture.</p>

<p>Swiss’s politically neutral state allowed many designers to continue producing work and function during the war. Thanks to the existing Swedish 50’s designs, Fleckhaus acquired much of his design inspirations from Swiss designers such as Richard Paul Lohse and Max Bill. He also looked upon American magazines such as Esquire for design layouts and photo aspects. His decision in the use of striking, black and white, erotic images caught a lot of attention. As Willy McBride (Twen magazine photo journalist) put it, “We were both world changers. We both used the magazine to show the way the world could be.” The bold sans serif typefaces with generous amount of white space was exhibited throughout the entire magazine. Printed in 265 x 335mm size, Twen magazine followed the Bauhaus method, taught by Max Bill. Fleckhaus’s method of a 12-column grid, combining columns to produce 3-6 column layouts with justified texts became his trademark.

<p>Aside from his intelligent layout, Fleckhaus also gained a nickname as “super cropper” from his photo editing: intentionally zooming into the model’s lips or cutting off the figure’s torso. Photo cropping was Fleckhaus’s biggest defect yet advancement to the magazine. Many world-known authors and famous photographers like Willy McBride, strived to have the opportunity to work with Fleckhaus yet it was known that his radical cropping and reconstructing agitated many photojournalists.

<p>However, one cannot deny his dramatic pictorial scaling moreso augmented the emotional impact for the viewers. He turned photos into “statements” rather than illustrations to decorate the page. The photos on the page did not compete with the texts, instead worked cohesively like puzzle pieces. He often mimicked the photos with typefaces or using justified texts, imitating the gestures of the models. Although Fleckhaus extracted many features of American magazine aesthetics, he kept Twen magazine’s beautiful offset color and black and white gravure prints for it appeared much more elegant compared to the low-cost American letterpress color prints.</p>

<p>To Fleckhaus, the magazine served as a means to express his ideas and interests. He was not interested in the ornate design aspects of the magazine. Design was merely a vehicle for expressing ideas. He believed that the magazine could not live solely by the sophisticated layouts. It is the poems and stories of the authors and photographers that make up the sum of the magazine. After eleven years as the art director of Twen magazine, Fleckhaus resigned but continued directing in other magazines and began teaching graphic design at Essen University. He taught his pupils to work from the inside outwards, not to simply decorate the surface. Although his name is hardly voiced today, he is one of the biggest influences amongst the world of modern graphic designers and classified as “Germany’s first art director”. Many of his students control and stride throughout Germany today as art directors. If it were not for his design, the modern graphic aesthetic would not exist.</p>
