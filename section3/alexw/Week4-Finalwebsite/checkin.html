 <h2> Every year there is an influx of Ouroborians who check themslves into the 'clinic'- a place Ouroborians go for a month or elaxation and lesiure until they are sacrificed to be turned into food, leather, bones, donatable organs, skin, bone marrow, etc. They must go willingly, and there are absolutley no children allowed whatsoever because they are 1: not capable of such a decision, 2: not large and developed enough to provide enough meat, bones, etc. and 3: they need to be old enough to reproduce and create an offspring to replace themselves. The euthanization of the volunteers is performed as humanley as possbile. </h2>
