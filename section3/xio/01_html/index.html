         <h1> My Favorite Carebears </h1>

         <p> 
         The Care Bears are a group of multi-colored bear characters. The original artwork was painted by artist Claire Russell for American Greetings in 1981 to be used on greeting cards; but the characters were later used for toys, and in TV programs and films.

<p> The Care Bears live in a magical place called Care-a-Lot. It's made up of clouds and rainbows, from where they watch over the feelings of all children around the world. Whenever they hear a "Care Bear Alert", they know they are really needed. Their motto is "Caring is what counts".
