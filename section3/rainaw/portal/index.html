<h1>        
Portals 
</h1>

<section>
A portal is defined as a doorway, gate, or other entrance, especially a large and elaborate one. Perhaps it is an opening to a cave or the entryway to a grand hotel. A portal will take you somewhere and reveal something to you. A portal is also a term used within computing. In this case, a portal is defined as an internet site providing access or links to other sites. The portal is the perfect space for any type of explorer, hikers and internet surfers included. I hope you find this portal to be a useful gateway and interesting way to process the concept of portals. I’ve used an interesting resource, The Center for Land Use Interpretation to discover new sites and portals.

Dedicated to the increase and diffusion of knowledge about how the nation’s lands are apportioned, utilized, and perceived.
The Center for Land Use Interpretation is a research and education organization interested in understanding the nature and extent of human interaction with the surface of the earth, and in finding new meanings in the intentional and incidental forms that we individually and collectively create. We believe that the manmade landscape is a cultural inscription, that can be read to better understand who we are, and what we are doing.
The organization was founded in 1994, and since that time it has produced dozens of exhibits on land use themes and regions, for public institutions all over the United States, as well as overseas. The Center publishes books, conducts public tours, and offers information and research resources through its library, archive, and website.
The CLUI exists to stimulate discussion, thought, and general interest in the contemporary landscape. Neither an environmental group nor an industry affiliated organization, the work of the Center integrates the many approaches to land use—the many perspectives of the landscape—into a single vision that illustrates the common ground in “land use” debates. At the very least, the Center attempts to emphasize the multiplicity of points of view regarding the utilization of terrestrial and geographic resources.

The Morgan Cowles Archive provides a rich archive of portals, collected from areas throughout the United States. There are portals all over the world, but it is interesting to understand and see the portals that attracted CLUI’s attention.

The Morgan Cowles Archive is the principal collection of images at the Center for Land Use Interpretation, as well as the initiative to preserve and present them to the public. The archive draws from over 100,000 images of thousands of places taken by people working for the CLUI since the inception of the organization in 1994.  
The archive exists primarily in electronic form, as a digital storage system, and a website. The most compelling and useful images from the CLUI’s photo archive are presented here, in themed catalogs, and added to over time, available for consideration and viewing by the public.  
The Morgan Cowles Archive is supported by an endowment from the family and friends of Morgan Cowles, in his memory. The endowment enables the Center to more effectively manage its vast and diverse collection of images and other documents, and to preserve them for present and future generations.  
Image use policy: We encourage the noncommercial distribution and enjoyment of the images. Requests for rights and reproduction should be made to the CLUI.
