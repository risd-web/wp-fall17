    <p> As we celebrate the best beauty launches of 2016, we also look ahead to see what's launching for 2017!

Beauty editors get early access to this type of top-secret information, and today we are going to share some of it with you. We got the scoop on the new Maybelline launches for January and are excited to reveal five of what we predict to be the buzziest drugstore launches. This curation includes Baby Lips crayons (!!!), a gorgeous new mascara, and more.

The cherry on top is that none of them are more than $16!

<ul>
<Li>Tip 1: To help your lip color last all day, apply lipstick with a lip brush and top it with a coat of translucent powder -- three times in a row. It won't budge. <br>You can top with gloss if you'd like. -- Amy Nadine, head makeup artist for mark cosmetics </Li>
<br>
<br>
<li>Tip 2: To make skin glow as if you've been drinking 10 glasses of water a day, highlight cheekbones with a frosted off-white shadow. -- Gregory Arlt, makeup<br> artist for MAC</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>Tip 3: To tone down a too bright cheek stain, apply a touch of foundation over the stain to give cheeks a more subtle flushed finish -- like you just pinched <br>your cheeks. -- Lori Taylor, Smashbox Regional Training Executive </li>
<br>
<br>
<li>Tip 4: Under sweltering conditions, don't continuously powder your face or the result will look cakey. Wait until just before you're ready to go out, then blot<br> excess moisture and set with powder. -- Lisa O'Connor, makeup artist</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>Tip 5: If you want a matte lip look without buying a new shade, simply dust a bit of powder over your lipstick to tone down the shine.<br> -- Sharon Gault, makeup artist for Smashbox</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>Tip 6: If you don't know what you're going to wear, keep makeup simple, clean and not too done. Apply a touch of an earthy color (such as sage green) on the<br> lids and keep the rest of your face neutral. -- Lisa O'Connor, makeup artist </li>
<br>
<br>
<li>Tip 7: For a full brow look, even if you've over-plucked, grab brow powder in a shade that matches your brows and a brow brush. Start by brushing<br> brows up, then fill in with powder under the arch for a more pronounced look. -- Sharon Gault, makeup artist</li>
