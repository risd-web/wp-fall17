            Welcome to RAZUMA's website. 
This is where I organize information about myself, as well as my works and contact information. Please feel free to look around. 

RAZUMA 
RAZUMA is just a nickname I use for my SNS accounts. 
RISD class of 2019, majoring in Illustration.
Graduated from Gyeonggi Suwon International School as Class of 2015, I am currently studying illustration in RISD. I have high interest in patterns, anime, games, graphic design, manga, and package design. As a student, I am still trying to find the best path for me to grow up as a successful artist. 
I love drawing, painting and designing various things. They make me feel like a god; creating life from none. I design characters and garments, usually without thinking about the context at all. Designing soothes me although they sometimes do give me hard times. Creating lives, stories, the world, seems to me the most attractive part of living an artistic life.
