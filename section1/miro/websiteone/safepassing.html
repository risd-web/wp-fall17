        <h4> SAFE PASSING LAWS </h4>

        <P>
        Rhode Island requires that the driver of a motor vehicle must pass a bicyclist by driving to the left of the bicycle at a safe distance, that is sufficient to prevent contact with the person operating the bicycle if the person were to fall into the driver’s lane of traffic, and returning to the lane of travel once the motor vehicle is safely clear of the overtaken bicycle. However, a driver of a motor vehicle need not follow that requirement when:
        </P>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Driving in a lane that is separate from and adjacent to a designated bicycle lane.</b></li>
          <li><b>Driving at a speed not greater than fifteen miles per hour.</b></li>
          <li><b>When the driver is passing a bicyclist’s right side and the person operating the bicycle is turning left.</b></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        The driver of a motor vehicle may drive to the left of the center of a roadway to pass a person operating a bicycle proceeding in the same direction only if the roadway to the left of the center is unobstructed for a sufficient distance to permit the driver to pass the person operating the bicycle safely and avoid interference with oncoming traffic.
        </p>
