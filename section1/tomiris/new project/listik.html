    	<h1>LISTIK THE CAT</h1> 
       	<img src="IMG_1093.PNG"/>

       	<p>Listik came to our family the Summer of 2017. He was a small kitten who found a path to our door. He is 4 months old and represents the the Californian Spangled breed.</p>

       	<ul>
		<li>The Californian Spangled Cat was bred in the 1980s to resemble wild cats like the ocelot and leopard.</li>
		<li>Although they were initially expensive due to their rarity, the breed has since been overshadowed by the Ocicat and Bengal.</li>

      <h3>EAt first sight this cat looks like a miniature version of the leopard. In fact, the California Spangled Cat's long, cylindrical body helps it move like a hunter on the prowl. Often in the shape of blocks, these leopard-like spots especially stand out when they are in contrast with the coat's background color.</h3>

      <h4>The California Spangled Cat is energetic, active, and, though it sports a wild look, easy to tame. Affectionate and intelligent, it will return its owner's love in full measure, though it will also scheme to get its way.</h4>

		<h1>Personality and Temperament</h1>
		The California Spangled Cat is energetic, active, and, though it sports a wild look, easy to tame. Affectionate and intelligent, it will return its owner's love in full measure, though it will also scheme to get its way.

		<p>A born athlete, Listik is capable of acrobatic high jumps. Therefore, it would be prudent to keep fragile valuables safely stored. The cat is also fascinated by moving objects and loves to hunt.</p>

		Thanks for yur attention. Bye!
