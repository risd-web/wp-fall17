			The Institute fo? Contempo?a?y Inqui?y was founded in 2017 by a group of curious objectors who asked: how can we imagine a kinder, more generous future? How can we develop strategies to thrive in inhospitable conditions? Like many other curious objectors before them, they sought answers in the desertscapes of Southern California. But rather than finding the answers that they initially sought, they encountered more questions. Every surface – from the abandoned borax mines to the Eureka sand dunes to the Naval Air Weapons Station to the Ubehebe Crater– provoked new lines of inquiry. As one of the founders recalls, “The questions rose out of the salt flats like a fucking superbloom!!” They were in awe of the beauty of inquiry and founded the Institute as an excuse to continue questioning. 

	In the desert, questions often remain underground for years, awaiting rain or curious objectors, like y*u.

	The Institute fo? Contempo?a?y Inqui?y does not have a physical site. It is “a psychic location.” Every spring, the Institute hosts an annual gathering in Death Valley called supe?_b!**m. At super_b!@@m, gatherers use the conditions in Death Valley – natural and man-made – as surfaces for further inquiry and present their question-results to other gatherers.
