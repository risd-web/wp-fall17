			A lost-and-found is a place where lost items are kept to await reclaiming by their owners. It is a physical location but it is also a state of mind. It is optimistic and utopian, assuming accidental abandonment and creating the conditions for a possible reunion. 
			</p>
			<p>	Lost&amp;      is a collection for critical optimism. It is an archive of future artifacts from events that have yet to happen. We ask artists to consider what is missing in the context of the political now and to imagine what it might mean to encounter those things in the future. They are tasked with contributing these future artifacts, and in some cases, actualizing the conditions (performances, conversations, workshops) in which they could be used. 
			</p>
			<p>Each piece in the exhibition is a potential stage for engagement. We encourage artists to propose a performance or interactive program that relates to their work. </p>

			<p>A publication will support the exhibition, featuring the work of participating artists and local writers. </p>
