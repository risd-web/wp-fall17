            <p>When you arrive in Telluride, you will come face to face with the beautiful San Juan mountains. The San Miguel River runs through the town, which sits in a box canyon below a popular ski resort. There are many popular hikes you can take during your visit, including a spectacular trek to Bear Creek Falls. If water sports are your style, there are endless opportunities for SUP, kayaking and rafting. The ride into town features elk and prairie dogs. Or just enjoy the views from your campsite and the main stage.
