            <p>The community at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival makes this experience like no other. Some festivarians attend the festival year after year. There are several campsites to choose from. If you are selected from the lottery, you have the opportunity to stay at the infamous Town Park campground, where all the traditional camps make their home for the week of the festival. Campgoers at Town Park arrive the weekend before the festival, with special events held throughout the week. Special events include rumballs, the goddess walk and musical performances before the show even begins.
