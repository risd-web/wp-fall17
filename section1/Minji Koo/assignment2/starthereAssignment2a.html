	<h1>About Tea</h1>
		<p> Teas are wooden or plastic stand used to prop up golf balls in a golf course. They are designed with two ends. One end is sharp and pointed, meant to be easily inserted into sod, while the other is circular and shaped like a cup in order to facilitate the spherical form of a golf ball. </p>

		<p> Tea is actually short for the Tea Party Movement, members of which think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgec9WX21ik">this</a> is acceptable behavior. I'm not sure why they have the term for dirty leaf water in their name.</p>
